/**
 @brief The ViewModel class is the generic class for any ViewModel.
 
 It provides an internal interface for any inherited specialised ViewModel to bind itself
 to a model object.
 The second public interface is for controlls who owns the view model typically.
 
 Any inherited class from ViewModel can use the observableManager to create binding
 between the own model object and their properties. The bindingUpdaterOnSelector method
 can help to do the bindings directly to the ViewModel.
 
 Any owner of the ViewModel shall use the bind and unbind methods of the class. But shall not
 use the observableManager property and the bindingUpdaterOnSelector method.
